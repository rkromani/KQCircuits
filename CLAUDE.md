This is a package derived from the public KQCircuits package used to design superconducting qubits and test their performance using simulation tools (I use ANSYS, not Elmer, which is common in example files).

Most of the work I do is in the @C:\Roger\KQCircuits\klayout_package\python directory, and most of that is in elements in the @C:\Roger\KQCircuits\klayout_package\python\kqcircuits\elements directory.

A common workflow is to make modifications to a design (e.g. @C:\Roger\KQCircuits\klayout_package\python\kqcircuits\elements\resonator_spike.py), look at it using KLayout, then modify an existing simulation script (e.g. @C:\Roger\KQCircuits\klayout_package\python\scripts\simulations\spike_res_sim.py), run that, then run the .bat files generated by that script to run a set of ANSYS simulations. You should do development by running scripts, and checking the output using the terminal. You should not run the resultant .bat files, as these make simulations which take a long time to run. To run this script, you need to be in the env-kqcircuits-py312 enviornment with the package you are working on installed.

Reference @C:\Roger\KQCircuits\MESHING_LAYERS_IMPLEMENTATION.MD for notes on how adding meshing layers were implemented.
